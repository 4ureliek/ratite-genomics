Whole genome alignment
===============

We used [progressiveCactus](https://github.com/glennhickey/progressiveCactus) to generate
a whole genome alignment from 35 bird genomes and 7 non-avian reptile outgroups. Our
version of progressiveCactus uses a modified version of [jobTree](https://github.com/harvardinformatics/jobTree) in order to work with SLURM.
