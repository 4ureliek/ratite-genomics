---------

For the second (final) run of MAKER, we use the following inputs:
1. RNA-seq data: TopHat junctions converted to GFF (see TopHat directory)
2. RNA-seq data: Trinity assemblies (see Trinity directory)
3. Protein data: full proteomes from 10 species (same as MAKER run 1)
4. Trained gene finders: SNAP & Augustus (notPer training for tinamous, droNov training for emu, ratite training for everything else)
