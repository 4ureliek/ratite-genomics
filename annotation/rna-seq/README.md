RNA-seq
===============

We used a combination of existing RNA-seq resources from SRA and new RNA-seq data to generate
Trinity assemblies for use in MAKER annotation.

*Note: need to add list of SRA accesions*

For each species, we first trimmed and preprocessed sequences, and then ran Trinity with the code
in 04_run_trinity.sh.
