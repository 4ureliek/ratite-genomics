Scripts and other material for the assembly and analysis of ratite genomes. This is a work
in progress, so expect frequent changes and updates. Raw data will be available after publication,
at which point the script and code in this repository will facilitate replication of our work.

**Disclaimer:** Although we welcome re-use of these materials, except where noted the code
we are sharing here is specific to this project and to the Harvard compute cluster. 
Filenames and paths are often hard-coded in scripts, and software versions/dependencies are
often managed via calls to the Harvard Odyssey cluster Lmod system.


Organization of this repository
------------

Each directory contains the scripts for a particular analysis, along with a README describing
that analysis. In many cases logs and/or output files are also stored in a subdirectory 
under each analysis.
